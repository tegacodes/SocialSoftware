<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Description</h3>
<p>We now spend more time with our devices than we do with our friends and loved ones. We sleep next to these little computers and imagine their vibrations in our pockets. Our daily social interactions are increasingly mediated by these machines â€“ their glowing interfaces promising new forms of intimacy and connection. How are these technologies changing how we relate each other? Are they enabling us to build better relationships and understand ourselves in new ways? How are artists, technologists and researchers exploring the possibilities offered by computation for both individual and collective change? This course investigates these questions both from critical, creative and technical perspectives.</p>

<p>Through an exploration of practice and theory, students will enhance their creative and technical skills by developing a series of creative online and offline works. Projects will explore how computational technologies shape and are shaped by our social norms, human desires and behaviours, ranging from conceptual proposals through to the development basic software applications that interact with data and online media platforms.</p>

<p> There will be weekly homework tasks set, some of these will be conceptual and some of these will be technical coding exercises. Homework will be checked each week and is designed to prepare you for assignment tasks. You are expected to document your homework and assignments on a personal blog.
</p>
<h4>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Reading</h4>

<p>Reading material will be assigned for many weeks of term. Readings will be made available either as links to documents on the web or via email. Generally, thirty minutes of each class will be devoted to a discussion of the reading. Discussions will be led by different students each week.</p>

<h4>
<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Attendance</h4>
<p>
You are expected to attend all class sessions. Absences due to non-emergency situations will only be cleared if you let me know a week (or more) in advance, and even then only for compelling personal or professional reasons (e.g., attending an important conference, going to a wedding). If you're unable to attend class due to contagious or incapacitating illness, please let me know (by phone or e-mail) before class begins.

Each unexcused absence will deduct 5% from your final grade. If you have three or more unexcused absences, you risk failing the course.

Be on time to class. If you're more than fifteen minutes late, or if you leave early (without clearance), it will count as an unexcused absence.

<p>I will have office hours from 11am - 1pm every Thursday. My office is in Natural Sciences rm 2053.</p>
  <p>I will not respond to personal emails with code questions, but ask them instead on the class google group! We will answer questions here so that everyone can learn, we also strongly encourage you to answer each other's questions. Please feel free to write us with logistical, conceptual, or other questions!</p>
  <p>See the HELP! section on the <a href="http://tegacodes.github.io/socialsoftware/Resources">resources page</a> for more tutorials on debugging and asking for help.</p>
