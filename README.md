We now spend more time with our devices than we do with our friends and loved ones. We sleep next to these little computers and imagine their vibrations in our pockets. Our daily social interactions are increasingly mediated by these machines – their glowing interfaces promising new forms of intimacy and connection. How are these technologies changing how we relate each other? Are they enabling us to build better relationships and understand ourselves in new ways? How are artists, technologists and researchers exploring the possibilities offered by computation for both individual and collective change? This course investigates these questions both from critical, creative and technical perspectives.  

Through an exploration of practice and theory, students will enhance their creative and technical skills by developing a series of creative online and offline works. Projects will explore how computational technologies shape and are shaped by our social norms, human desires and behaviours, ranging from conceptual proposals through to the development basic software applications that interact with data and online media platforms.  
  
Prerequisties: Programming for Visual Artists or Programming for Games.  

Ethos and Practice  

This is a studio course and as such you will be expected to experiment, read, discuss and make. We will be doing some experimental works that may involve performance and personal research.   

We will also be doing some programming using the Python language. Why Python? Because it’s easy to learn, it makes text processing easy and is flexible in its applications.
