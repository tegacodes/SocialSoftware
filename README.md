We now spend more time with our devices than we do with our friends and loved ones. We sleep next to these little computers and imagine their vibrations in our pockets even when they are still. Our daily social interactions are increasingly mediated by these machines – their glowing interfaces promising new forms of intimacy and connection. How are these technologies changing how we relate each other? Are they enabling us to build better relationships and understand ourselves in new ways? This course investigates these questions both from critical, creative and technical perspectives.

We will consider social practice in both historic and contemporary art. How are artists, technologists and researchers exploring the possibilities offered by technology for both individual and collective change. From this context students will enhance their creative and technical skills by developing a series of creative online and offline works. Projects will explore how computational technologies shape and are shaped by our social norms, human desires and behaviours, ranging from conceptual proposals through to the development basic software applications that interact with data and online media platforms.
